abstract: Scientific evidence regularly guides policy decisions1, with behavioural
  science increasingly part of this process2. In April 2020, an influential paper3
  proposed 19 policy recommendations (‘claims’) detailing how evidence from behavioural
  science could contribute to efforts to reduce impacts and end the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Here we assess 747 pandemic-related research articles that empirically investigated
  those claims. We report the scale of evidence and whether evidence supports them
  to indicate applicability for policymaking. Two independent teams, involving 72
  reviewers, found evidence for 18 of 19 claims, with both teams finding evidence
  supporting 16 (89%) of those 18 claims. The strongest evidence supported claims
  that anticipated culture, polarization and misinformation would be associated with
  policy effectiveness. Claims suggesting trusted leaders and positive social norms
  increased adherence to behavioural interventions also had strong empirical support,
  as did appealing to social consensus or bipartisan agreement. Targeted language
  in messaging yielded mixed effects and there were no effects for highlighting individual
  benefits or protecting others. No available evidence existed to assess any distinct
  differences in effects between using the terms ‘physical distancing’ and ‘social
  distancing’. Analysis of 463 papers containing data showed generally large samples;
  418 involved human participants with a mean of 16,848 (median of 1,699). That statistical
  power underscored improved suitability of behavioural science research for informing
  policy decisions. Furthermore, by implementing a standardized approach to evidence
  selection and synthesis, we amplify broader implications for advancing scientific
  evidence in policy formulation and prioritization.
