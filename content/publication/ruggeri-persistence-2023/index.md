abstract: While economic inequality continues to rise within countries, efforts to
  address it have been largely ineffective, particularly those involving behavioral
  approaches. It is often implied but not tested that choice patterns among low-income
  individuals may be a factor impeding behavioral interventions aimed at improving
  upward economic mobility. To test this, we assessed rates of ten cognitive biases
  across nearly 5000 participants from 27 countries. Our analyses were primarily focused
  on 1458 individuals that were either low-income adults or individuals who grew up
  in disadvantaged households but had above-average financial well-being as adults,
  known as positive deviants. Using discrete and complex models, we find evidence
  of no differences within or between groups or countries. We therefore conclude that
  choices impeded by cognitive biases alone cannot explain why some individuals do
  not experience upward economic mobility. Policies must combine both behavioral and
  structural interventions to improve financial well-being across populations.
