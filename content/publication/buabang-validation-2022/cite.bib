 abstract = {. In 2020, 17.1% of the population in the European Union                                   was at risk of poverty (Eurostat,                                               2021). Poverty is often assessed using objective measures such as                                       absolute and relative income levels. However, different individuals may                                         experience different levels of financial stress at the same income level.                                       Therefore, it is crucial to have measures that capture the subjective components                                        of poverty. In this multinational study, we tested the validity and measurement                                         invariance of the Personal Financial Wellness (PFW) scale across six European                                   countries (Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, and the UK) and the                                        US, and six languages (German, Italian, Dutch, Slovenian, Spanish, and English).                                        Results provided mixed evidence for the fit of the expected one-factor                                  structure. Exploration of a modified one-factor structure indicated an improved                                         fit. The scale showed excellent reliability, and convergent and discriminant                                    validity. This suggests that the PFW scale captures subjective financial stress                                         and is a dependable self-report measure. Measurement invariance testing of the                                  modified one-factor model showed metric invariance across Slovenia, Spain, the                                  UK, and the US. Given that scalar invariance was not achieved and the invariance                                        testing was based on an exploratory model, we do not advise the use of the scale                                        for comparisons between countries.},
