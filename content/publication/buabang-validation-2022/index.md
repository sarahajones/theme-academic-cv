abstract: . In 2020, 17.1% of the population in the European Union                                   was
  at risk of poverty (Eurostat,                                               2021).
  Poverty is often assessed using objective measures such as                                       absolute
  and relative income levels. However, different individuals may                                         experience
  different levels of financial stress at the same income level.                                       Therefore,
  it is crucial to have measures that capture the subjective components                                        of
  poverty. In this multinational study, we tested the validity and measurement                                         invariance
  of the Personal Financial Wellness (PFW) scale across six European                                   countries
  (Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, and the UK) and the                                        US,
  and six languages (German, Italian, Dutch, Slovenian, Spanish, and English).                                        Results
  provided mixed evidence for the fit of the expected one-factor                                  structure.
  Exploration of a modified one-factor structure indicated an improved                                         fit.
  The scale showed excellent reliability, and convergent and discriminant                                    validity.
  This suggests that the PFW scale captures subjective financial stress                                         and
  is a dependable self-report measure. Measurement invariance testing of the                                  modified
  one-factor model showed metric invariance across Slovenia, Spain, the                                  UK,
  and the US. Given that scalar invariance was not achieved and the invariance                                        testing
  was based on an exploratory model, we do not advise the use of the scale                                        for
  comparisons between countries.
