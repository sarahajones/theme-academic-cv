abstract: Positive deviants are individuals from disadvantaged circumstances who outperform
  the typically negative outcomes for their group. Research on positive deviance in
  behavioral sciences is scarce, although such information could provide valuable
  insights into overcoming inequalities useful for developing interventions. We tested
  choice patterns between positive deviants, low-income individuals, and the general
  population. Our aim was to investigate whether positive deviants perform differently
  on cognitive bias tasks compared to other individuals with low incomes or the general
  population. The instrument was tested in multiple countries (N = 1,722) to determine
  potential differentiation based on systems-level, social, and structural factors.
  We found no differences between income groups in the fourteen choice patterns assessed
  in our instrument involving cognitive biases, and only anecdotal differences in
  some financial behaviors. Such findings suggest that, while behavioral interventions
  will benefit individuals where appropriately implemented, systemic and structural
  factors are most critical for improving the financial well-being of entire populations.
