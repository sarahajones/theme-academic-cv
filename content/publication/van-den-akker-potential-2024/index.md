abstract: Study preregistration has become increasingly popular in psychology, but
  its potential to restrict researcher degrees of freedom has not yet been empirically
  verified. We used an extensive protocol to assess the producibility (i.e., the degree
  to which a study can be properly conducted based on the available information) of
  preregistrations and the consistency between preregistrations and their corresponding
  papers for 300 psychology studies. We found that preregistrations often lack methodological
  details and that undisclosed deviations from preregistered plans are frequent. These
  results highlight that biases due to researcher degrees of freedom remain possible
  in many preregistered studies. More comprehensive registration templates typically
  yielded more producible preregistrations. We did not find that the producibility
  and consistency of preregistrations differed over time or between original and replication
  studies. Furthermore, we found that operationalizations of variables were generally
  preregistered more producible and consistently than other study parts. Inconsistencies
  between preregistrations and published studies were mainly encountered for data
  collection procedures, statistical models, and exclusion criteria. Our results indicate
  that, to unlock the full potential of preregistration, researchers in psychology
  should aim to write more producible preregistrations, adhere to these preregistrations
  more faithfully, and more transparently report any deviations from their preregistrations.
  This could be facilitated by training and education to improve preregistration skills,
  as well as the development of more comprehensive templates. (PsycInfo Database Record
