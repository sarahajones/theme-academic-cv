abstract: Introduction Most mothers feel an immediate, strong emotional bond with
  their newborn. On a neurobiological level, this is accompanied with the activation
  of the brain reward systems, including the striatum. However, approximately 10%
  of all mothers report difficulties to bond emotionally with their infant and display
  impaired reward responses to the interaction with their infant which might have
  long-term negative effects for the child’s development. As previous studies suggest
  that activation of the striatal reward system can be regulated through functional
  MRI (fMRI)-based neurofeedback (NFB), we have designed and investigate fMRI-NFB
  training to treat maternal bonding difficulties. Methods and analysis In the planned
  trial, mothers will be presented pictures of their infant and real-time fMRI (rtfMRI),
  peripheral measures, neural, endocrine, psychophysiological and behavioural measures
  will be assessed. Mothers with bonding difficulties (n=68) will be randomised to
  one of two double-blind intervention groups at 4–6 months postpartum. They will
  participate in three repeated NFB training sessions with rtfMRI-NFB training to
  increase activation of (a) the ventral striatum or (b) the anterior cingulate. Interview
  data and real-time mother–infant interaction behaviour pre-intervention, post-intervention
  and at follow-up will serve as clinical outcome measures. Ethics and dissemination
  Study procedures are in line with the recommendations of the World Medical Association
  (revised Declaration of Helsinki) and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the
  Medical Faculty, s-450/2017, Heidelberg University. All participants will provide
  written informed consent after receiving a detailed oral and written explanation
  of all procedures and can withdraw their consent at any time without negative consequence.
  Results will be internationally published and disseminated, to further the discussion
  on non-pharmacological treatment options in complex mental disorders. Trial registration
  number DRKS00014570; Pre-results.
